    <p style="font-size: 25px;">An electric vehicle recharge bunk, also known as a charging station or charging point, is a facility where electric vehicles can be charged. These stations provide electricity to recharge the vehicle's battery, allowing the driver to extend the vehicle's driving range. EV recharge bunks can be found in various locations, such as public parking lots, shopping centers, and along highways, to support the growing number of electric vehicles on the road.</p>
